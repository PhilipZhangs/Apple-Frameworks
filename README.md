# Apple Frameworks Showcase

Welcome to the Apple Frameworks Showcase! In this project, I am learning SwiftUI and building an app that utilizes the MVVM architecture to present information about various Apple frameworks.

### App Features

- Explore frameworks in different views: List or Grid.
- Press on a framework to bring up a detailed view and learn more about its features.
